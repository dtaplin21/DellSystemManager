- Elevation: 1,200 feet above sea level

Site Boundaries:
- North: Property line at coordinate (0, 800)
- South: Property line at coordinate (0, 0)
- East: Property line at coordinate (1000, 0)
- West: Property line at coordinate (0, 0)

Obstacles:
1. Building A: Located at coordinates (200, 300), Dimensions: 50 ft x 30 ft, Type: Office building
2. Utility Pole: Located at coordinates (500, 400), Type: Electrical, Height: 40 ft
3. Tree Cluster: Located at coordinates (700, 200), Dimensions: 20 ft x 15 ft, Type: Mature oak trees
4. Storage Shed: Located at coordinates (150, 600), Dimensions: 20 ft x 15 ft, Type: Equipment storage
5. Water Tank: Located at coordinates (800, 600), Dimensions: 30 ft diameter, Type: Water storage

Access Paths:
1. Main Entrance: From (0, 0) to (100, 0), Width: 20 ft, Type: Paved road
2. Service Road: From (0, 400) to (1000, 400), Width: 15 ft, Type: Gravel road
3. Emergency Access: From (900, 0) to (900, 100), Width: 12 ft, Type: Emergency vehicle access

Terrain Type: Flat with slight slope (2% grade from North to South)
Soil Conditions: Clay loam, suitable for geosynthetic installation

Installation Constraints:
- Minimum 6-inch overlap on all seams
- Anchor panels at 10-foot intervals on perimeter
- Maintain 5-foot clearance from all obstacles
- Follow 2% slope for drainage
- Install drainage layer beneath all panels
- Use fusion welding for all seams
- Maintain 20-foot access corridor around perimeter

Environmental Considerations:
- Wetland area at coordinates (50, 50), Dimensions: 100 ft x 50 ft (avoid installation)
- Protected tree area at coordinates (750, 150), Dimensions: 50 ft x 30 ft (maintain 10-foot buffer)
- Drainage outlet required at coordinates (950, 0)

Quality Control Requirements:
- Verify panel dimensions before installation
- Check seam quality after welding
- Document all installation activities
- Perform leak testing on all seams
- Maintain installation log with photos
