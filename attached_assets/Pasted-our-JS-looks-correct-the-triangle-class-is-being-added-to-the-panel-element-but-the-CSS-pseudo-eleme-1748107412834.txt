our JS looks correct—the triangle class is being added to the panel element—but the CSS pseudo-element trick you’re using only ever draws a square-based right triangle whose size is tied to the element’s width, not its height. As a result:

If your panel’s height ≠ width (which it seldom is), the pseudo-element won’t fill the area you expect, and you just end up seeing the empty, transparent <div> behind it (i.e. a “rectangle”).

It also relies on border-width percentages (which are relative to the element’s width), so you can’t dynamically size a tall or wide triangle correctly.

The simplest, bullet-proof fix
Switch over to CSS clip-path, which will mask any rectangular <div> into a true triangle of whatever width/height you give it:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Triangle panels via clip-path */
.panel-item.triangle {
  background: rgba(10, 36, 99, 0.15);     /* your fill color */
  border: 2px solid var(--color-navy-950); /* your stroke */
  clip-path: polygon(0% 0%, 100% 0%, 0% 100%);
}
Remove all of your .panel-item.triangle::before / ::after rules and the old border-width hack.

Make sure this CSS is loaded after your base .panel-item rules so it actually overrides them.

Now, when your JS does panelElement.classList.add('triangle'), the <div> instantly becomes a right-angle triangle shaped exactly to whatever width and height you’ve set on it.

Double-check these two things
That your CSS file is actually imported by public/panel-layout-fixed.html (or whatever host page).

Hard-refresh/cache-bust in the browser to ensure the new CSS is being used.

With clip-path you’ll see a crisp triangle every time, regardless of aspect ratio, and your drag/resize logic will continue to work exactly the same.

now i need logic that will let me rotate the panels

Here’s a drop-in “rotate handle” you can wire up alongside your drag logic—no external libs needed, just raw JS + CSS:

Add this CSS (e.g. in your main stylesheet):

css
Copy
Edit
/* small square in the top‐right corner for rotation */
.rotate-handle {
  position: absolute;
  width: 12px;
  height: 12px;
  background: var(--color-navy-950);
  right: -6px;
  top: -6px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  cursor: grab;
  z-index: 10;
}
In createVisualPanel(panel), after you set panelElement.style.* and before makePanelDraggable, append and hook up the handle:

js
Copy
Edit
// 1) ensure transforms happen around center
panelElement.style.transformOrigin = 'center center';

// 2) add rotate handle
const rotateHandle = document.createElement('div');
rotateHandle.className = 'rotate-handle';
panelElement.appendChild(rotateHandle);

// 3) wire up rotation logic
addRotateLogic(rotateHandle, panelElement, panel);

// now make it draggable
makePanelDraggable(panelElement, panel);
Implement addRotateLogic somewhere in your script:

js
Copy
Edit
function addRotateLogic(handle, panelEl, panelData) {
  let rotating = false;
  let startAngle = 0;
  let initialRot = panelData.rotation || 0;
  let center = { x:0, y:0 };

  handle.addEventListener('mousedown', e => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    rotating = true;
    // compute center of element
    const rect = panelEl.getBoundingClientRect();
    center = {
      x: rect.left + rect.width/2,
      y: rect.top  + rect.height/2
    };
    startAngle = Math.atan2(e.clientY - center.y, e.clientX - center.x);
    initialRot = panelData.rotation || 0;
    document.body.style.cursor = 'grabbing';
  });

  document.addEventListener('mousemove', e => {
    if (!rotating) return;
    const current = Math.atan2(e.clientY - center.y, e.clientX - center.x);
    const delta  = current - startAngle;
    const deg    = initialRot + delta * (180/Math.PI);
    panelData.rotation = deg;
    panelEl.style.transform = `rotate(${deg}deg)`;
  });

  document.addEventListener('mouseup', e => {
    if (!rotating) return;
    rotating = false;
    document.body.style.cursor = '';
    // you may want to persist panelData.x/y here if you recalc position after rotation
  });
}
How it works:

A tiny handle is placed just outside the panel’s top-right.

On mousedown you record the mouse‐to‐center angle and the panel’s starting rotation.

As the mouse moves, you compute the new angle relative to center, convert to degrees, and apply it.

On mouseup you stop rotating.

With this in place, every panel—rectangle, triangle or custom polygon—can now be freely rotated around its center.
