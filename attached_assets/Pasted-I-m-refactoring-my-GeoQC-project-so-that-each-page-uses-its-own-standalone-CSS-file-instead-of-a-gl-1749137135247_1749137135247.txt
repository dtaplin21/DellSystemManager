I’m refactoring my GeoQC project so that each page uses its own standalone CSS file (instead of a global Tailwind build). I want each HTML/JSX page to include only the CSS rules it needs—just like the “free-trial.html” page, which has all its styles embedded or referenced locally. For each route or React component in the project (e.g. index.html, free-trial.html, dashboard page, projects page, panel-layout page, etc.), please:

1. Extract any Tailwind classes or global-CSS dependencies and convert them into a dedicated per-page stylesheet (e.g. free-trial.css, dashboard.css, projects.css, panel-layout.css). 
2. In each HTML/JSX file, replace the `<link href="global CSS file"` or Tailwind directives with a `<link>` to the new per-page CSS file.
3. Copy over only the CSS rules actually used on that page (you can manually inline small chunks or leave them as an external CSS file, but scoped just to that page).
4. Ensure no page still imports `globals.css` or `tailwind.css`—each page should stand alone with its own CSS file.

For example:
- **`public/free-trial.html`** already has inline styles inside `<style>` tags. Create `public/css/free-trial.css` and move those styles in, then update `free-trial.html` to link `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/css/free-trial.css">`.
- **`frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`** should have a new `dashboard.css` under `frontend/src/app/dashboard/`. Convert every Tailwind class used in that component into equivalent CSS selectors in `dashboard.css`, then import it at the top of `page.tsx` (e.g. `import './dashboard.css';`).
- Repeat for **`/dashboard/projects`** (create `projects.css`), **`/dashboard/panel-layout`** (create `panel-layout.css`), **`/dashboard/qc-data`** (create `qc-data.css`), etc.

Please produce:
- A list of pages/components and their new CSS filenames.
- For each page, sample CSS (or complete) that replaces Tailwind classes with equivalent rules.
- The updated HTML/JSX file header showing how to link/import the new per-page CSS.
- Any build/config changes necessary (e.g. removing Tailwind from PostCSS, adjusting Next.js config so it doesn’t purge global.css).

At the end, I want each page to be entirely self-contained (HTML/JSX + its own CSS file), without relying on any global Tailwind or shared CSS.
