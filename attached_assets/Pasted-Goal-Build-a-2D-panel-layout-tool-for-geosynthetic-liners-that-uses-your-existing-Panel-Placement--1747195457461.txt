Goal: Build a 2D panel-layout tool for geosynthetic liners that uses your existing “Panel Placement” Excel templates as the source of truth and makes it dead-simple for end users—whether they draw panels by hand or let AI do the heavy lifting.

Base Schema (from ZIP):
– Use the “Panel Placement Form” tables in the Panel placement WPWM folder (Primary Area A, Primary Area B, Secondary Area C) to define your manual-entry modal. For every panel, surface these fields exactly:

Date

Panel #

Length (ft)

Width (ft)

Roll Number

Panel Location / Comment
– Preload the project header info into the UI (Project Name, Location, Description, Manager, Material) so users never have to re-type it.

Requirements:

Auto-Layout Mode

Accept a batch of panel records (from Excel import or user form) and automatically arrange them on a grid, scaled to square-foot and linear-foot dimensions.

Interpret free-text instructions (e.g. “Place panel 3 at the northeast corner, 2' inset”) via your OpenAI agent chain.

Export the final layout in CAD-friendly format (DXF/DWG).

Manual Mode

Show a “Create Panel” modal with the six fields above, plus a dropdown to select shape type (rectangle, polygon, circle).

Allow drag-and-drop placement, click-and-drag resize handles, zoom in/out, and a “Fit to Scale” button.

Embedded AI Chat

Embed your existing OpenAI model and secret key so the chat widget retains full project context.

Let users type commands like “Combine panels 4 and 5 into one 20×30 rectangle” and instantly see updates.

Simplify for Users & Developers

Provide preset panel templates for common liner sizes (e.g. 60 mil × 100 ft rolls).

Real-time validation that warns if panels overlap or exceed liner area.

Tooltips on each input and a one-click “How it Works” guide.

Supply npm packages (e.g. react-canvas-grid, dxf-writer) and environment variable examples in your README.

Your Task:
Paste this prompt into your AI chat and then:

Spin up the React/Next.js scaffolding for the panel-layout component.

Wire in the manual-entry modal based on the Excel schema.

Hook up the auto-layout algorithm and CAD exporter.

Embed the AI chat widget with full context preservation.

Include a sample data CSV (matching the templates) and a copy-paste code snippet for easy Replit integration.

Make every step as plug-and-play as possible so the next developer can drop it into your Replit project and start drawing, automating, and exporting their geosynthetic panel layouts immediately.
